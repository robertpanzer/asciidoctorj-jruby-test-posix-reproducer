= Reproducer for PosixShim.size returning wrong results

To reproduce run the test PosixTest in a debugger.

Set a breakpoint in PosixTest.test() line 14.

Then set a breakpoint in org.jruby.util.io.OpenFile.remainSize() and see what it returns for the test file which has a size of 156 bytes.
But PosixShim.size() seems to return non-deterministic results.

Tested on:

- JDK 17.0.1-zulu
- MacOS 12.1
- Apple M1 Pro
